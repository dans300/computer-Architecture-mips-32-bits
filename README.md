This was a project for the University of Antioquia where i designed a computer in Logisim that supported the Mips-32 architecture .It supports several typical instructions from this architecture and has an added feature where it has an instruction that the processor runs an algorithm to display sequentially contents in memory ,essentially an algorithm run in hardware instead of software .This solution was made as a sort of print function for the user using finite state machines making this single-cycle instruction processor a hybride as it is both combinational and sequential depending on the instruction . The final report is in spanish but you can clearly see its architecture and the depiction of the methods used.
